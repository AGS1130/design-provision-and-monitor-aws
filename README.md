# Design, Provision and Monitor AWS Infrastructure at Scale

This is the second project in the Udacity AWS Cloud Architect Nanodegree.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to cement knowledge in planning, designing, provisioning, and monitoring infrastructure in AWS by optimizing infrastructure for cost and performance by using industry-standard and open source tools (Terraform) to provision and configure AWS services in a global configuration. The template used in this project originates from [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/cand-c2-project).
